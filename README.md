# YouStore - E-Commerce Website Development

## Project Overview

**YouStore** is a full-stack e-commerce website project where the objective is to develop a functional front-end based on provided graphic designs. As a front-end developer within the YouStore team, the mission involves implementing the design across multiple pages and ensuring a seamless user experience that meets modern web design standards using **HTML5** and **CSS3**.

## User Stories

The following user stories have been implemented:

1. As a user, I want to view the list of products (Home page).
2. As a user, I want to see the details of a product, including its description, price, features, and customer reviews, to make informed purchasing decisions.
3. As a user, I want to add products to my shopping cart and remove them, then proceed to checkout when ready by providing my payment information.
4. As a user, I want to check the status of my order, including delivery tracking, to know when I will receive my products.
